    <p>if parsing errors occur, likely some memory error or crash in console will be reported, since i havent augmented it with error checking, and it is only client side</p>
    <p>when that happens your code is as broken as mine</p>

    <h1>player section</h1>

    <p>for each player, an integer representing the board rotation (their viewing angle, 0-3 counterclockwise) is required, followed by their name and a newline. example:</p>
    <pre>
0 White
2 Black

    </pre>
    <p>note the blank line, terminating parsing of additional players</p>

    <h1>board section</h1>
    <p>the board is taken literally; every line is a row and columns are sequential. the board width is the width of the longest row. each column is either three spaces in a row, indicating an empty square, a player number (starting at zero) followed by a single character defining the piece. after the piece, arrows (^ or v or > or < or any of ↖↗↙↘) are optionally (mandatory for pawns) used to declare the direction the piece goes in (and when it may be promoted)</p>

    <p>piece characters:</p>
    <pre>
K - king
P - pawn
H - "heir"/commoner, moves like a king but cannot be checked or mated
Q - queen
B - bishop
N - knight
R - rook
A - archibishop (knight + bishop)
C - chancellor (knight + rook)
    </pre>

    <p>finally, the board must end with a blank line, just like http requests (except the carriage return is omitted)</p>
